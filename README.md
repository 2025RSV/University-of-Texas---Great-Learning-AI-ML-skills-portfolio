# University-of-Texas---Great-Learning-AI-ML-skills-portfolio
Applied AI/ML work from the UT Austin–Great Learning Postgraduate Program, focused on practical model development, business impact, and enterprise-ready ML workflows.


This repository documents my hands-on work and applied learnings from the Postgraduate Program in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning delivered by Great Learning in collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin.

The program emphasizes practical, business-driven AI/ML implementation, combining statistical foundations, modern machine learning techniques, and real-world problem solving. My work focuses on translating models into actionable insights, operational decisions, and scalable solutions—not just academic outcomes.

Key areas of focus include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering for structured datasets

Supervised learning (classification & regression) using models such as Linear/Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Ensemble methods

Model evaluation, tuning, and tradeoff analysis using business-relevant metrics

Translating model outputs into clear recommendations for stakeholders

End-to-end ML workflows aligned with enterprise delivery and governance practices

Projects in this repository reflect realistic business scenarios (finance, operations, risk, customer analytics) and are structured to mirror how AI/ML initiatives are delivered in production environments—bridging data science, engineering, and program execution.

This work supports my broader focus on AI program leadership, AI governance, and enterprise-scale AI delivery, integrating machine learning capabilities into measurable business outcomes.
